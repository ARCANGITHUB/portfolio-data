## 📈 Insights

- 🧍‍♂️ **Consumer segment** drives most of the sales, especially in the West and East regions. However, it has the lowest profit margin (≈11.5%), possibly due to higher discounts or lower pricing flexibility.  
- 🏠 **Home Office segment** achieves the **highest profit margin (≈14.0%)**, despite lower total sales — suggesting an effective pricing strategy or lower operational costs.  
- 💼 **Technology** and **Office Supplies** are the most profitable categories overall.  
- 🪑 **Furniture** has low margins and even records losses in the Central region.  
- 🌎 **East and West regions** generate the highest sales and profits, while the **South region underperforms** across all categories.  
- 📆 **Sales and profits show strong seasonality**, peaking in **November and December** — likely due to holiday demand.  
- 📈 **Year-over-year growth** is consistent in both sales and profit, indicating overall business expansion.
